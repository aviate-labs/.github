Thank you for using one of Aviate Labs' packages! If you need help, continue reading... ðŸ™‚

## I need help or have a question about one of the packages.

If you have a question about Motoko, it might be better to ask it on the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/).
Otherwise if the question is about the package itself, feel free to open an issue.

## I found typos, missing or outdated documentation.

If you want to report something that is wrong or missing from the documentation, please open a new issue/pr in the respective repository.

## I want to talk to other developers.

The [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/) and [official developer Discord](https://discord.gg/raqHw2PU3z) is a good place to meat other people!
